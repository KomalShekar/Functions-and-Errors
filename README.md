# Mysterious Event Smart Contract

Welcome to the Mysterious Event smart contract repository! This Solidity smart contract manages access to an exclusive event with mysterious age criteria.

## Features

- **Age Verification:** Ensure only individuals with an even age and meeting additional criteria can access the event.
- **Guest Count:** Track the number of guests who successfully passed the mysterious age verification.
- **Conditions:** Utilize `require`, `revert`, and `assert` for clear and secure logic.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mysterious-event.git
**Compile and Deploy:**
Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler and deploy it to your Ethereum network.

**Customize Age Verification Conditions:**
Modify age verification conditions in the contract logic to fit your event requirements.


// Customize age verification conditions
require(age % 2 == 0, "Sorry, only those with an even age can access the secrets.");
